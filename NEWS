ppp (2.4.3-20041231+3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed patch 057_pppoe-interface-change which was refused by the
    upstream maintainer. Now users must arrange for the ethernet
    interface used for PPPoE to be up.
  * The PPPoA plugin does not require anymore the libatm1 package to be
    installed.
